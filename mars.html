    <h2>Mars has captivated humans since we first set eyes on it as a star-like object in the night sky.<br>
         Early on, its reddish hue set the planet apart from its shimmering siblings, each compelling in its own way, but none other tracing a ruddy arc through Earth’s heavens.<br>
          Then, in the late 1800s, telescopes first revealed a surface full of intriguing features—patterns and landforms that scientists at first wrongly ascribed to a bustling Martian civilization.<br>
           Now, we know there are no artificial constructions on Mars. But we’ve also learned that, until 3.5 billion years ago, the dry, toxic planet we see today might have once been as habitable as Earth.</h2>

    <h1>10 Facts about Mars</h1><br>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is a terrestrial planet which means that like Earth it has a hard, rocky surface you can walk on.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            Mars is called the Red Planet because of all the iron in the soil. This iron rusts and as a result, makes the surface and atmosphere look red.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          Mars may look warm but it’s very cold. The average temperature is -62 degrees Celsius. 
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            Mars has two moons, and their names are Phobos and Deimos.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            Mars can have huge dust storms which last for months and can cover the entire planet.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            A day on Mars is 24.6 hours, not much longer than an Earth day, but a year on Mars is 687 Earth days long. That’s almost twice as long as an Earth year. 
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            You’d be able to jump much higher on Mars because it has weaker gravity than Earth, and this means you’d weigh less too.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            The atmosphere on Mars is about 100 times thinner than the Earth’s atmosphere, and it has very little oxygen. You wouldn’t be able to breath the Martian air and would need a spacesuit with oxygen when you went outdoors.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            Humans haven’t been to Mars yet, but NASA has sent several rovers there already, and Perseverance is the fifth. The first one was called Sojourner and it landed in 1997. Spirit and Opportunity landed in 2004, and the last time NASA landed a rover on Martian soil was in 2012

      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            In 2018, NASA’s Curiosity rover found signs which scientists think mean there once was life on Mars. Perseverance’s job will be to dig deeper – literally - by drilling into the surface!
